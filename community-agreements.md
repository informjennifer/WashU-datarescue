# üôè Community Agreements

{% hint style="info" %}
This is an example of the Community Agreements used for the Seattle Data Rescue. Customize as desired.
{% endhint %}

At Data Rescue events, we strive to support and create an environment that encourages all participants‚Äîorganizers, supporters, any and all stakeholders to hold safe, engaging, and respectful environments where each person is able to focus as much of their energy on the Data Rescue‚Äôs intent.

These are our suggested community agreements for all Data Rescue event as designed by the Collective Responsibility: [Code of Conduct and Community Agreement ‚Äì Collective Responsibility](https://laborforum.diglib.org/code-of-conduct-and-community-agreement/). We ask all volunteers to help uphold these community practices and principles.&#x20;

#### _We Practice Community By‚Ä¶_ <a href="#practice" id="practice"></a>

* _making space/taking space‚Äîencouraging and yielding the floor to those whose viewpoints may be under-represented in a group, taking space made for you as you‚Äôre able;_
* _respecting a person‚Äôs description of their experiences of marginalization or discrimination (and not excusing, explaining, or defending the intentions of those in the dominating group);_
* _using welcoming language (including a person‚Äôs pronouns) and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns (‚Äúfolks‚Äù or ‚Äúy‚Äôall,‚Äù not ‚Äúguys‚Äù);_
* _accepting critique graciously and offering it constructively;_
* _giving credit where it is due;_
* _seeking concrete ways to make physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible;_
* _practicing self and community care‚Äîpay attention to your body‚Äôs needs and, as Active Bystanders, to the welfare of those around us._

As we are also planning to share physical or virtual spaces at the University of Washington, we ask that you abide by the university's [Code of Conduct](https://lib.uw.edu/about/policy/conduct/). Violations of these agreements may result in request to leave the event and building.&#x20;

Here is the rationale on why community agreements are supportive for community spaces: [Group Agreements - Seeds for Change](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/groupagree)

Community agreements will differ for in-person and online spaces. Here are sample of community agreements in different contexts:

* [Community Agreements and Code of Conduct | Lighting the Way - Spotlight at Stanford](https://exhibits.stanford.edu/lightingtheway/about/community-agreements-and-code-of-conduct)
* [Social rules - Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules)

We invite community members to suggest and/or share any other resources or samples that might be relevant and helpful as we build a welcoming and respectful environment towards our collective goals.
