# üôè  Code of Conduct
This is a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion or technical skill level. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from events and online forums. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organizing team immediately.

Organizers will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your participation!

# üí¨ Community Agreements

At Data Rescue events, we strive to support and create an environment that encourages all participants (organizers, supporters, and stakeholders) to hold safe, engaging, and respectful environments where each person is able to focus their energy on the Data Rescue‚Äôs intent.

We ask all volunteers to help uphold these community practices and principles.&#x20;

#### We Practice Community By‚Ä¶  <a href="#practice" id="practice"></a>

* _making space/taking space‚Äîencouraging and yielding the floor to those whose viewpoints may be underrepresented in a group, taking space made for you as you‚Äôre able;_
* _respecting a person‚Äôs description of their experiences of marginalization or discrimination (and not excusing, explaining, or defending the intentions of those in the dominating group);_
* _using welcoming language (including a person‚Äôs pronouns) and favoring gender-neutral collective nouns (‚Äúfolks‚Äù or ‚Äúy‚Äôall,‚Äù not ‚Äúguys‚Äù);_
* _accepting critique graciously and offering it constructively;_
* _giving credit where it is due;_
* _seeking concrete ways to make physical spaces and online resources more universally accessible;_
* _practicing self and community care‚Äîpay attention to your body‚Äôs needs and, as Active Bystanders, to the welfare of those around us._

Here is the rationale on why community agreements are supportive for community spaces: [Group Agreements - Seeds for Change](https://www.seedsforchange.org.uk/groupagree)
We invite community members to suggest and/or share any other resources or samples that might be relevant and helpful as we build a welcoming and respectful environment towards our collective goals.
