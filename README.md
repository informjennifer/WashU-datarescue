Modeled after the 2016-2017 DataRescue movement that responded to hostile conditions towards environmental and climate science data, these ad hoc digital archiving volunteer events invite community members to apply their technical skills and social values in response to new threats to important data. While Data Rescues can focus on any type of at-risk public and government data, many have focused on environmental issues given[documented threats and modifications](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0246450) by recent political agendas. Open to public suggestions and contributions, this is a living document that is created and informed by documentation and literature from the 2017-2018 Data Rescues and by community-informed brainstorming discussions.&#x20;

The following Gitbook pages include:

* [Background](what-are-data-rescues.md) information on the history of past Data Rescue efforts
* Guide on [How To Start](how-to-start/) contributing to Data Rescues goals
* Detailed instructions on contributing to Data Rescue track tasks ([communication](how-to-start/track-1-communications.md), [assessment](how-to-start/track-2-data-assessment.md), [technical](how-to-start/track-3-technical.md))
* A growing list of [Learning Resources](resources-and-tools/) (readings and tools)
* [Updates page](resources-and-tools/updates.md) for information about other projects going on right now
* [Contact information](stay-in-touch.md) to connect with other relevant networks and communities
