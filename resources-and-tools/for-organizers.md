#### Short-term repositories
* For the Seattle Data Rescue, we used several different options to transfer data—participants could submit small files via a Google Form, they could use WeTransfer, or they could email it to the organizers. Use whatever resources you have (including these and others), but be aware that all may have size and institutional affiliation limitations. 
* These repositories should be linked on the [Track 3](../how-to-start/track-3-technical.md) documentation

### Customizing this Gitbook
You're welcome to fork this Gitbook or reuse the contents in other forms as desired. Several pages, including [Collecting Scope](collecting-scope.md) and [Community Agreements](community-agreements.md) include information that is not relevant outside of the Seattle Data Rescue events, but is included to help organizers develop their own information. 

Don't forget to update the Community Scope and Community Agreement, remove the info tags at the top of some of the pages, and add in links to your own infrastructure.

### Suggested Frequently Asked Questions for communications

Q: I am not feeling well, will you provide basic PPE (masks/sanitizing wipes)?

A: This is a mask-friendly event, and we encourage attendees to bring and wear masks for added protection against COVID-19. We encourage everyone who might feel under the weather to either attend via zoom OR come to the next Data Rescue event (if condition improves).

#### Q: What devices or equipment do I need to bring?

A: This is a BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) sort of event meaning participants are invited to bring along whatever devices they might need to contribute their skills. If this means just a pen and paper, that’ll do! NOTE: we do have a limited supply of laptops in case yours goes on the fritz last minute.

#### Q: How much programming or technical skills does a participant need?

A: For these Data Rescues, we only require surface level understanding of technology meaning do you know key differences between a physical and digital, do you have basic computer skills or have an interest in developing more, and can you understand the core threats to digital files like deletion and corruption?

#### Q: Is there anything I need to read or review in preparation for the event?

A: There is no required reading prior to attending the event, but you are welcomed to explore our [Gitbook documentation](https://calma.gitbook.io/datarescue) that shows suggested tasks, some potential readings, and overall information on the event structure.

#### Q: Do I need to be there the entire time?

A: No, these Data Rescue events are set up as Drop-Ins where most people can complete a digital preservation task within the hour. No one is expected to stay beyond that or arrive right at the start of the event.&#x20;

#### Q: Can I bring a friend?

A: Yes, friends and family (all ages) are welcome but please note that we are limited in in-person space. If more people arrive than we anticipated, we may ask you and your guest to move to our overflow spaces (both online or in-person). You are also welcomed to invite your friend to attend the next Data Rescue event.
