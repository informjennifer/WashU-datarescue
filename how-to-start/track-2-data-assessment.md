### SUGGESTED TASKS & INSTRUCTIONS

#### 1. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Identify at-risk federal government web pages</mark>

🚁**Summary:** Volunteers will search through a list of US government departments and agencies for websites that have not yet been copied into the [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org/) (rescued). If the site is not in that archive yet, nominate it to be included.

💁**Role:** Web Archivist

🗂️**Workflow:**&#x20;
* Go to WashU's Data Tracker at { DATA TRACKER LINK } - Find the Web Archiving Tracker tab on the spreadsheet.
* Navigate to https://www.usa.gov/agency-index - Choose a letter A-Z; at this point, you may choose randomly.
* Go through the agencies starting with that letter one by one. Find the website of each agency.
* Go to the End of Term Nomination Tool at https://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2024/ and search for the agency's website.
* The Nomination Tool will tell you if the website has been archived already. Either way, you will note what you did in the WashU Data Tracker (Box spreadsheet). 
  * If it isn't in the EoT archive already:
      * Continue to fill out the nomination form as best you can with information from the usa.gov website. Submit, and know that you just saved a website!
      * ALSO, fill out WashU's data tracker at {{{{BOX LINK}}} - Our data tracker asks you to note these fields: Agency (Name of the US agency), Webpage Name (might be the same; that's okay), URL, whether it was in the EoT already (No), and, if you nominated it, today's date. Ignore the fields about the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.
  * If it IS in the EoT archive already:
     * Go to the WashU Data Tracker, navigate to the Web Archiving Tracker sheet, and enter agency, webpage name, URL, and mark Y to note that that URL is in the EoT already. Ignore the fields about the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.
* If there's anything to report to a WashU data coordinator (something went awry; something was wonderfully successful), leave a note in the notes field on the WashU Data Tracker.

🛠️**Skills Needed:** Be able to browse through web pages, check if the site is in the End of Term archive or not, and then fill out a WashU Box spreadsheet detailing what you did. 

#### <mark style="background-color:purple;">2. /records</mark>&#x20;

🚁**Summary**: Description (at times also called metadata) helps with the management and access to digital records. Information about the content and context helps with identification, assessment, and verification of authenticity.

💁**Role:** Metadata Cataloger

🗂️**Workflow**

* Read [dublin core basic manual ](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/usageguide/)to learn about the use of metadata for digital records (for explanation on selected metadata fields, see section 4. Elements)
* Navigate to the [**link to Data Tracking List**] sheet (stay on the first tab “EDIT TO THIS TABLE”)&#x20;
* Select a row with an item that is marked as "Needs Metadata" (this info found in column K)
* Fill-in descriptive text for your select row for all 5 metadata columns (these are columns P through U colored in teal blue)
* Use Data Tracking sheet for title and URL to find other information to create description
* When metadata has been entered, change status of row in column K to "Needs Checksum" &#x20;

🛠️**Skills Needed:** Have reading and writing literacy in English language to create metadata in English. Ability to distinguish between different types of metadata fields (who, what, when, where, how)

  * Internet Archive-  use [Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak?pli=1), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/), or [Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wayback-machine/id1472432422) browser extension to capture webpage OR entr URL directly via the Wayack Machine (navigate to "[Save Page Now](http://web.archive.org/)" option)
  * End of Term - use the project's [nomination form](https://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2024/add/) to add URL, title, & government data type
* Update row status to “Captured" on the spreadsheet
* Repeat process for a new submission

🛠️**Skills Needed:** Be able to browse through web pages and use a browser extension button (listed in above Tools Required) to notify the Internet Archive or the End of Term project, which has been preserving federal webpages since 2008. Once the URL to the web page has been submitted to Internet Archive, the EoT will automatically process the webpage for long term preservation into their repository.
