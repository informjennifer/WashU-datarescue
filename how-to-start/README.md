# ‚≠ê How To Start


Hello & welcome!

For a video introduction to this Github site, click here (5 minutes) https://app.screencastify.com/v3/watch/dhSoj6c7tOPUrOGoPWnM. A transcript of the video is available [as a PDF document](https://wustl.box.com/s/py2s32rmrej7cfz8l3f5motn07y9sf0s).

Thank you for volunteering your time for this year‚Äôs Data Rescue (2025)! We appreciate your energy, enthusiasm, or whatever other motivator brought you here. Now that you‚Äôve read through the purpose, goals, and background of past and present Data Rescues, we can get you started on contributing.

Whether you are just now thinking about responding to current data risks and threats or you are involved in long term data preservation work, the possibilities for digital archival preservation abound. No matter your skill set, field of expertise, or interests, there is a digital archiving task for you!

Now that you‚Äôve reviewed the general expectations and background information, we ask all volunteers to following these steps to start:

1. Submit an [anoynmous participation survey](https://wustl.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2reEOCtWu6Niowm) 
   indictating which track you are interested in. 
2. Read the [community agreements](../community-agreements.md) page.&#x20;
3. Review track summaries (below) to pick a path.&#x20;
4. Navigate to the track Gitbook page (see sidebar drop down or below links),&#x20;
5. Pick 1 task on the ones listed on your select track to begin (some may require installing tools)
6. Follow instructions for selected task under the "workflow" header to complete the task
7. Work on your selected task (ask for clarification or help from Coordinators)
8. REPEAT steps 2-6 if you want to take on another task (or go to the LAST STEP to say bye)üëãüèº&#x20;
9. Submit an exit ticket (summary of all your work) using this form [**link to Work Completion Status Form**]

### Track List Options

The following options can be considered a sort of ‚Äúchoose your own adventure‚Äù with each area focused on a different stage of digital preservation. As Data Rescue events are set up to welcome all skills, each track has a core focus but includes various tasks that can be completed usually within an hour.

#### [Track 1  (Advocacy & Education)](track-1-advocacy-education.md)

This track focuses on creating, revising, and sharing information about at-risk data. This includes adding context about collected data in order to improve management and findability of data for future purposes.

#### [Track 2 Web Archiving](track-2-web-archiving.md)

This track focused on nominating at-risk websites for capture to the End of Term Archive. It's not currently offered, but may be again in the future.

#### [Track 3 (Data Capture)](track-3-data-capture.md)

This track focuses on the actual capture of at-risk data in a variety of formats. As these tasks require the most technical knowledge, skills, and equipment, volunteers are encouraged to take this track if they are able to dedicate more time or have previous experience in digital preservation and information management.
