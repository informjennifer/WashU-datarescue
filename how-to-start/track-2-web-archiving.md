# üîç Track 2 (Web Archiving)

This track is not currently utilized. The previous task involved nominating websites to [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org/). As of March 31, 2025, nominations there have ended. From EoT: 

"The reason for ending nominations for EOT is that we want to have a distinct dataset for research purposes. We've always done before inauguration/after inauguration snapshots for that purpose. EoT is in the process of writing a blog post announcing end of seed nominations and next steps. so be on the lookout for a post on EoT's [Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/eotarchive.org)"

Data Coordinators at WashU will update this space when we have a web archiving task that we can manage with your help!
