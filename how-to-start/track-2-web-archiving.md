# 🔍 Track 2 (Web Archiving)

This track focuses on finding and evaluating valuable and at-risk websites. Utilizing the [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org/), volunteers will identify websites that need to be duplicated and submit them to this non-governmental website repository.

**Tech Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate

**Time Commitment:** ~30min-1 hour

**Tasks Include:**

1. Identify and submit at-risk web pages
2. Familiarization with alternate sources for governmental web content

**Tools Required (vary across tasks):**

1. For Task 1, use a library computer or your own. You just need a web browser
1. For Task 2, use your own computer if you'd like to continue to nominate websites going forward beyond this event. Try a Wayback Machine extension/add-on:
   1. [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak?pli=1)
   2. [Firefox add-on](https://web.archive.org/web/20230212035050/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/)
   3. [Safari Extension](https://web.archive.org/web/20230212035050/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wayback-machine/id1472432422)

### SUGGESTED TASKS & INSTRUCTIONS

#### 1. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Identify at-risk federal government web pages</mark>

🚁**Summary:** Volunteers will search through a list of US government departments and agencies for websites that have not yet been copied into the [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org/) (rescued). If the site is not in that archive yet, nominate it to be included.

💁**Role:** Web Archivist

🗂️**Workflow:**&#x20;
* Go to WashU's Data Tracker at https://wustl.box.com/s/qwnaoqn3em9fh6erp0k53m7wrqe1efo8 - Find the Web Archiving Tracker tab on the spreadsheet.
* Navigate to https://www.usa.gov/agency-index - Choose a letter A-Z; at this point, you may choose randomly.
* Go through the agencies starting with that letter one by one. Find the website of each agency.
* Go to the End of Term Nomination Tool at https://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2024/ and search for the agency's website.
* The Nomination Tool will tell you if the website has been archived already. Either way, you will note what you did in the [WashU Data Tracker](https://wustl.box.com/s/qwnaoqn3em9fh6erp0k53m7wrqe1efo8) (Box spreadsheet). 
  * If it isn't in the EoT archive already:
      * Continue to fill out the nomination form as best you can with information from the usa.gov website. Submit, and know that you just saved a website!
      * ALSO, fill out WashU's data tracker at https://wustl.box.com/s/qwnaoqn3em9fh6erp0k53m7wrqe1efo8 - Our data tracker asks you to note these fields: Agency (Name of the US agency), Webpage Name (might be the same; that's okay), URL, whether it was in the EoT already (No), and, if you nominated it, today's date. Ignore the fields about the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.
  * If it IS in the EoT archive already:
     * Go to the WashU Data Tracker, navigate to the Web Archiving Tracker sheet, and enter agency, webpage name, URL, and mark Y to note that that URL is in the EoT already. Ignore the fields about the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.
* If there's anything to report to a WashU data coordinator (something went awry; something was wonderfully successful), leave a note in the notes field on the WashU Data Tracker.

🛠️**Skills Needed:** Be able to browse through web pages, check if the site is in the End of Term archive or not, and then fill out a WashU Box spreadsheet detailing what you did. 

#### <mark style="background-color:purple;">2. Other web archiving activities</mark>&#x20;

🚁**Summary**: This task is for the person interested in archiving websites for any number of reasons, who would like to perform independent web archiving on their own computer.

💁**Role:** Web Archivist

🗂️**Workflow**

* Do you depend on a website that's in danger of disappearing? Maybe it's a personal site, and there's no guarantee the owner will renew domain name. Perhaps you know of websites that need to be archived, but that aren't US federal government websites. There are other options beyond the [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org/)
  * Check out the extensions, add-ons, and apps at the top of this page. Whether you use Chrome on a laptop or browse the web on an iPhone, you can contribute pages to the Internet Archive - the largest web archive in the world.
    * If you create an account at Internet Archive, and save a certain number of websites, you can have Internet Archive create a collection for you, which you can arrange and manage. 
  * Use [Conifer](https://conifer.rhizome.org/) to capture dynamic sites. The archived website will live in your Conifer account - not the Internet Archive.
