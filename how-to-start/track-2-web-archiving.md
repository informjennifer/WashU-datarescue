# üîç Track 2 (Web Archiving)

This track focuses on finding and evaluating valuable and at-risk websites. Utilizing the [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org/), volunteers will identify websites that need to be duplicated and submit them to this non-governmental website repository. This track also recommends further web archiving resources. 

**Tech Skill Level:** Beginner/Intermediate

**Time Commitment:** ~30min - 1 hour

**Tasks Include:**

1. Identify and submit at-risk web pages
2. Familiarize yourself with alternate methods of ensuring content on the web remains accessible

**Tools Required (vary across tasks):**

1. For Task 1, use a library computer, or your own device. You just need a web browser.
1. For Task 2, if you'd like to continue to nominate websites going forward beyond this event, use your own computer to try any of the following tools:
   1. Try a Wayback Machine extension/add-on:
       1. [Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wayback-machine/fpnmgdkabkmnadcjpehmlllkndpkmiak?pli=1)
       2. [Firefox add-on](https://web.archive.org/web/20230212035050/https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/)
       3. [Safari Extension](https://web.archive.org/web/20230212035050/https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wayback-machine/id1472432422)
       4. [iOS app](https://web.archive.org/web/20230212035050/https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wayback-machine/id1201888313)
       5. [Android app](https://web.archive.org/web/20230212035050/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.archive.waybackmachine)
   1. Use [Conifer](https://conifer.rhizome.org/) to capture dynamic content (content that requires user interaction to be fully shown).

### SUGGESTED TASKS & INSTRUCTIONS

#### 1. <mark style="background-color:purple;">Identify at-risk federal government web pages</mark>

üöÅ**Summary:** Volunteers will search through a list of US government departments and agencies for websites that have not yet been copied into the [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org/) (rescued). If the site is not in that archive yet, nominate it to be included.

üíÅ**Role:** Web Archivist

üóÇÔ∏è**Workflow:**&#x20;
* You'll need three tabs or windows open: 
    * Navigate to WashU's Data Tracker at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13JTbYVAdSgRpwbQ6FZXFkTVqhmokv6g3tCCMbSSug4A/edit?usp=sharing - No login is necessary - Find the Web Archiving Tracker tab on the spreadsheet.
    * Navigate to https://www.usa.gov/agency-index
    * Navigate to End of Term Nomination Tool at https://digital2.library.unt.edu/nomination/eth2024/
* On the usa.gov site, choose a letter A-Z; at this point, you may choose randomly. Go through the agencies starting with that letter, one by one.
* Copy the URL of a website for an agency. Go to the End of Term Nomination Tool (EoT) and search for the agency's website.
* The Nomination Tool will tell you if the website has been archived already. Either way, you will note what you did in the WashU Data Tracker spreadsheet. 
  1. NO - If it isn't in the EoT archive already:
      * Continue to fill out the nomination form as best you can with information from the usa.gov website. Submit, and know that you just saved a website!
      * ALSO, fill out WashU's data tracker.
          * Our data tracker asks you to fill out a fiew metadata fields (columns).  (Check the README tab of the WashU Data Tracker spreadsheet if you have questions about what to put in each field.)
  2.  YES - If it IS in the EoT archive already:
     * Go to the WashU Data Tracker, navigate to the Web Archiving Tracker sheet, and enter agency, webpage name, URL, and mark Y to note that that URL is in the EoT already. 
* If there's anything to report to a WashU data coordinator (something went awry; something was wonderfully successful), leave a note in the notes field on the WashU Data Tracker.

üõ†Ô∏è**Skills Needed:** Be able to browse through web pages, check if the site is in the End of Term archive or not, and then fill out a WashU Box spreadsheet detailing what you did. 

#### <mark style="background-color:purple;">2. Other web archiving activities</mark>&#x20;

üöÅ**Summary**: This task is for the person interested in archiving websites for any number of reasons, who would like to perform independent web archiving on their own computer.

üíÅ**Role:** Web Archivist

üóÇÔ∏è**Workflow**

* Do you depend on a website that's in danger of disappearing? Maybe it's a personal site, and there's no guarantee the owner will renew domain name. Perhaps you know of websites that need to be archived, but that aren't US federal government websites. There are other options beyond the [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org/).
  * Check out the extensions, add-ons, and apps at the top of this page. Whether you use Chrome on a laptop or browse the web on an iPhone, you can contribute pages to the Internet Archive - the largest web archive in the world.
    * If you create an account at Internet Archive, and save a certain number of websites, you can have Internet Archive create a collection for you, which you can arrange and manage. 
  * Use [Conifer](https://conifer.rhizome.org/) to capture dynamic sites. The archived website will live in your Conifer account - not the Internet Archive.
* Have further interest in web archive collections? The WashU Libraries Web Archive will officially launch later this spring, but in the meantime, you can take a peek at our collection of WashU websites over the years here: https://archive-it.org/collections/4726
* Questions? Comments? Please feel free to reach out to WashU's Web and Email Archives Coordinator, Sarah Weeks, at sweeks@wustl.edu
