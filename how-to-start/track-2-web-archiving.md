# üîç Track 2 (Web Archiving) (Version 2.0)

This is the second version of Track 2, designed so that anyone can contribute to data rescue efforts using web archiving techniques on their own. Here, you can also learn how to do web archiving for your own personal use. Web archiving saves <i>websites</i>; if you'd rather help with saving <i>datasets</i>, visit Track 3.

### 1. Followup from initial Data Rescue web archiving
At spring Data Rescue events at WashU, participants nominated URLs from a list of government websites at https://www.usa.gov/agency-index to the End of Term web archive at https://eotarchive.org/. Following that initiative, web archivists at Webrecorder created an additional, similar resource. Learn about that here:

### 2. Save Page Now: Simple contributions to the Wayback Machine at archive.org
You can save a single page (not a whole website) by going here:

   #### https://web.archive.org/save/

   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55bd7d5e-e19c-4e62-89e8-34e9235eb5c6)

Pop in a URL, hit Save Page, and you're done!
Note the "Sign in to use extra features" section. If you're interested in those...read on.

### 3. Creating your own collection: Complex contributions to the Wayback Machine at archive.org

If you'd like to save a whole website - not just one page - in the Wayback Machine, or if you'd like to curate your own collection of archived websites (for yourself and/or others to see and use), this section is for you. 

#### What are the web collections? What do they offer?

To check out the web collections to see if you're interested, go to archive.org and click this yellow icon:

Here's what you'll see - all the web collecitons:

The collections have robust metadata, meaning the sortable and customizable facets you can see down the left side of this screenshot:

### 4. Archive Team: Help a team of web archivists with your computing power

To quote the Archive Team itself, it is a "loose collective of rogue archivists, programmers, writers and loudmouths dedicated to saving our digital heritage." Entirely volunteer-run, Archive Team learns of at-risk websites and tries to save them. It's been in existence since 2009 and is independent of any particular web archive. If you can run a virtual machine, that's one way to help them:

#### https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php/ArchiveTeam_Warrior

> The Archive Team Warrior is a virtual archiving appliance. You can run it to help with the Archive Team archiving efforts. It will download sites and upload them to our archive‚Äîand it‚Äôs really easy to do!

> The warrior is a container running inside a virtual machine, so there is almost no security risk to your computer. ("Almost", because in practice nothing is 100% secure.) The warrior will only use your bandwidth and some of your disk space, as well as some of your CPU and memory.

### 5. ArchiveWeb.page and Conifer: Two great and easy-to-implement web archiving tools
 
#### ArchiveWeb.page
This tool is for saving web pages on your own computer - using just your browser. It's best for personal use. It can be utilized easily as a Chrome extension. Go to https://archiveweb.page/

#### Conifer
Conifer is a way to save complex, dynamic websites - the kind that require you to hover over or interact with them in order to show all the content. It's also for personal use. Go to https://conifer.rhizome.org/
